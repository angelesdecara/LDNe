# LDNe
Programs used for JEB 2019

Codes provided: resub.f90, Every100gens10chrLDvsCorr.f90 and LDtoNe.f90
Data provided: r2_multi.txt

resub.f90 requires subru.f90, also included. It generates r2_multi.txt, which is r^2 as results from the multinomial approximation to the exact transition probability method.

Every100gens10chrLDvsCorr.f90 is the code of individual-based simulations of 10 chrosomes with 1M each for 5000 individuals. It returns r^2, R^2 after ngen generations stored every 100 generations. It can be stored every generation removing" if(mod(igen,100).eq.0) then" lines and their closing "endif"s.

LDtoNe.f90 reads r2_multi.txt and the files generated by Every100gens...f90 to infer Ne from LD.
